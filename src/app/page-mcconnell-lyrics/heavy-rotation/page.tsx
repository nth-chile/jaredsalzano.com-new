    And on and on until the<br />
    Motion is slowing down<br />
    The heavy rotation’s<br />
    At the end of its run<br />
<br />
    The dawn is gone and now<br />
    A night’s worth of memories that<br />
    Have come up again<br />
    The second time’s no fun<br />
<br />
    And on and on the thread of<br />
    Total distraction’s not<br />
    My best course of action<br />
    If my engine should stall<br />
<br />
    If all evolves it could be<br />
    Your praying mantis<br />
    I don’t know if I planned this<br />
    If it’s what I’d call<br />
<br />
    But the music that came and went<br />
    Amusements that paid the rent<br />
    Rules that were slightly bent<br />
    Never too far<br />
<br />
    And engagements that paid the bills<br />
    With nothing but time to kill<br />
    The only thing I wish still<br />
    Held me apart<br />
<br />
    And on and on, life that’s<br />
    Just held together with <br />
    A knot. I can weather<br />
    Not the storm but the calm<br />
<br />
    I’m hanging on until my<br />
    Treads get some traction<br />
    Then I’m flung into action<br />
    If I like it or not<br />
<br />
    And on and on until<br />
    Past tension release<br />
    I’m flying into the pan<br />
    I’m frying [??]<br />
<br />
    And ride beyond until<br />
    The waves have no glory<br />
    It’s the end of the story<br />
    But it’s short of defeat <br />
<br />
    The music that came and went<br />
    Amusements that paid the rent<br />
    Rules that were slightly bent<br />
    Never too far<br />
<br />
    And engagements that paid the bills<br />
    With nothing but time to kill<br />
    The only thing I wish still<br />
    Held me apart<br />
