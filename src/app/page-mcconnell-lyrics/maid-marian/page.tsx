    Hesitating as you pull the rug from me<br />
    Heading toward the ground<br />
    Reaching for the curtains<br />
<br />
    Can’t relate because I’m only trying to see<br />
    If instead of me (?)<br />
    I could have been more certain<br />
<br />
    Such a different way to play the thing<br />
    Such a difficult thing to say<br />
    To someone that you care for<br />
<br />
    “All’s forgotten.” They can say it if they please<br />
    Still I lay awake<br />
    All the way to daybreak<br />
<br />
    But I won’t let myself go there again<br />
    Cause I’m not falling through thin air again<br />
    But I’m not looking for Maid Marian<br />
<br />
    Such a desperate way to trade your wings<br />
    For your eighteen-inch spinning rims<br />
    With neon underneath you<br />
<br />
    Pass the last goodbye in laps of luxury<br />
    With my history<br />
    A couple cars behind me<br />
<br />
    I won’t let myself go there again<br />
    Cause I’m not falling through thin air again<br />
    But I’m not looking for Maid Marian<br />
<br />
    Circumnavigated feelings weigh on me<br />
    Explanations from a door without a key<br />
    Should I try to understand<br />
    Or should I try to be?<br />
<br />
    Expectation’s taking you away from me<br />
    Opportunity<br />
    Sounded good in theory<br />
<br />
    Calculations seldom come with guarantee<br />
    What I really want<br />
    Is someone that can hear me<br />
<br />
    Such a different way of playing it<br />
    If you’d only take time to see<br />
    Everything it should be<br />
<br />
    Fleeting feelings feed the longing quality<br />
    To experience<br />
    Emotions deep inside me<br />
<br />
    But I won’t let myself go there again<br />
    Cause I’m not falling through thin air again<br />
    You don’t have to be Maid Marian<br />
    I’m not looking for Maid Marian<br />
    Cause I’m not marrying Maid Marian<br />
