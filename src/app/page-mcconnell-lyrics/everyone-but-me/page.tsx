    Accusations, alibi<br />
    The more that I know, the more I deny<br />
    Never less than a step ahead, so I put on my disguise<br />
    And I’m wondering if the truth knows where it lies<br />
<br />
    Split decisions, stealing signs<br />
    Forget them again, shadows on my mind<br />
    Try to piece it together, which leads to my demise<br />
    And I ask myself, "Should I really be surprised?"<br />
<br />
    I get up, only to find that the feeling’s<br />
    Corrupt. Disrupted by demons downstream<br />
    I wake up, only to find that my sleep’s <br />
    Interrupted by dreams deconstructing my scenes<br />
<br />
    Owning up, but only in ways that betray just how <br />
    Close to the vest I can possibly get<br />
    Give it up. All of my deep-seated screams and the <br />
    Years full of fears that I’m not all I should be. Enough<br />
<br />
    Tell me one thing, change your mind<br />
    Just catching glimpses ahead of my time<br />
    High expectations, what the hell can I say?<br />
    I didn’t have a lot to do with the way I was made<br />
<br />
    I get up, only to find that the feeling’s<br />
    Corrupt. Disrupted by demons downstream<br />
    I wake up, only to find that my sleep’s <br />
    Interrupted by dreams deconstructing my scenes<br />
<br />
    Owning up, but only in ways that betray just how <br />
    Close to the vest I can possibly get<br />
    Give it up. All of my deep-seated screams and the <br />
    Years full of fears that I’m not all I should be. Enough<br />
<br />
    You listen to everyone but me<br />
    You listen to everyone but me<br />
    You listen to everyone but me<br />
    You listen to everyone but me<br />
