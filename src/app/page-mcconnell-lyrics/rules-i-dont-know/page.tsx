    The crew crept in closer, over-exposed<br />
    As they captured a couple frames more<br />
    The shots just got tighter and the reels run despite our<br />
    Last gasp on the cutting room floor<br />
    <br />
    Attempts to resurrect the folding chairs on the deck<br />
    As the actors and cameras collide<br />
    The tears swept away, better I should stay<br />
    It’s why I might keep it inside<br />
    <br />
    I watched as the flamethrower turned to my rainbow<br />
    To torch up my clean little shack<br />
    I sank as the reaper dug in even deeper<br />
    My sickle celebrity hack<br />
    <br />
    Sensing the fear that I might disappear<br />
    With no mind over matters of fact<br />
    Defenses in their place, but still I couldn’t trace<br />
    Less than half of what caused the attack<br />
    <br />
    How can I leave this behind me?<br />
    With all that’s around to remind me?<br />
    How can this road help unwind me<br />
    When it’s the road that I don’t go that defines me?<br />
    <br />
    What do these questions provide me?<br />
    Why do these answers divide me?<br />
    How can I put this behind me<br />
    When it’s the tears that I don’t cry that define me?<br />
    <br />
    Got my passport photo, had it taken today<br />
    Not the best one I’ve seen, but it should get me away<br />
    I’m in a situation and the color’s grey<br />
    It’s been such a long time that I’ve been feeling this way<br />
    Wouldn’t be so bad but seems like every third day<br />
    I see the same old movie and it always ends the same<br />
    <br />
    And the soundtrack starts rewinding<br />
    To a part not far behind me<br />
    I try not to let much get by me<br />
    But it’s the rules I don’t know that define me<br />
    <br />
    How can I leave this behind me?<br />
    With all that’s around to remind me?<br />
    How can this road help unwind me<br />
    When it’s the rules I don’t know that define me?<br />
