    In the middle of last week<br />
    The man began to speak<br />
    Words, a flurry of expressive<br />
    Extensive release<br />
<br />
    Now the complex wind prevails<br />
    And billowing our sails<br />
    Hell is not where you’d expect it<br />
    Accepting for free<br />
<br />
    Windmills, alpaca<br />
    Thermal extractor<br />
    Who’s keeping track of <br />
    Matter of factor?<br />
<br />
    He started to speak in the middle of last week<br />
    Talking for days, lending voice to the breeze<br />
<br />
    Time to take another cause<br />
    Or time to take a pause<br />
    Breathe, then float down to the bottom<br />
    You’ve got ’em this time<br />
<br />
    Michelangelo and on<br />
    With tales of Genghis Khan<br />
    Now who claims a victory?<br />
    But your gains you’ll never see<br />
<br />
    Windmills, alpaca<br />
    Thermal extractor<br />
    Who’s keeping track of<br />
    Matter of factor?<br />
<br />
    He started to speak in the middle of last week<br />
    Talking for days, lending voice to the breeze<br />
