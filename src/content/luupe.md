[The Luupe](https://theluupe.com/) is a community of photographers creating custom content for leading brands. The site started as a Wordpress blog, but as they grew into a network of photographers and brands, we built a web app that allows artists to create a portfolio, and allows brands to discover and hire artists. I made several iterations of theluupe.com that matched their visions and designs for what the product needed to be at that time. This was also my first opportunity to build a React UI library.
