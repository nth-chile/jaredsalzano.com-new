question: How does the process of hiring you go?
---

First, we can meet on a call or somewhere in NYC to discuss the project. Then, I'll send an estimate of how much I think it will cost and how long I think it will take. Typically, I can start right away and progress is fast. I can share a password-protected preview link so you can track the progress. We can meet as much as you like to discuss how it's going. If you want to manage the hosting and source code, we'll keep them on your accounts. Otherwise, I can host it for you. I'll remain available after the project for any updates you may need.
