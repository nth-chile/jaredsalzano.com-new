question: What will the quality of the end product be like?
---

It will be accessible, secure, performant, will follow good SEO and UX guidelines, and will look and work great on all devices and browsers. I write scalable code that doesn't have to be rewritten when you decide to add features, and readable code that others will know how to work with.
