question: How much will it cost?
---

Building a custom website typically starts at $2,000. More complex web applications are closer to $10,000. We can agree on fixed-price milestones or track hours, or, in the case of maintenance, agree on a monthly retainer. If I see an opportunity to save you money (by simplifying a project phase or in some other way), I will tell you.
