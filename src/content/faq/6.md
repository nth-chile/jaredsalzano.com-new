question: Which technologies do you use?
---

I’ve worked with most of the popular front-end tools over the years, but lately I default to React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS. For back-end services, Google Cloud Platform typically has what we need. If we need a CMS to make content editing easier for you or your team, we can choose one that suits the project. For mobile apps, I use React Native.
