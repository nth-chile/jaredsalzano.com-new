Having turned many of their own ideas into successful platforms through strategic marketing and content creation, Thought Catalog launched Thought Catalog Agency to help others achieve similar growth. They needed a website that was both visually compelling and highly functional.

They hired my brother [Gage](https://gagesalzano.com/) to design it, and me to build it.

The design emphasized a storytelling tone and animated infographics to reference the company’s editorial foundation. Because it featured unconventional layouts, often placing elements outside a standard grid, the challenge was to preserve the design’s visual integrity across different screen sizes. Gage had created desktop and mobile mockups, but everything in between was shaped through discussion and iteration. Adapting to team feedback required a flexible approach to styling. Tailwind CSS’s utility-first system suited the challenge, allowing me to work quickly without creating unwieldy stylesheets for myself and future developers.

The result was a snappy, polished user experience that not only matched the specs, but set a maintainable approach for future iterations.
