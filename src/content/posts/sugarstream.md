As a jam band fan, Iâ€™ve always used apps like [Relisten](https://relisten.net/) to listen to concerts. When I was learning to code and needed something to build, I made something similarâ€”several iterations, over the years, depending on the tech or concepts I was curious about at the time.

One day, a friend told me about [SugarMegs](https://sugarmegs.org/), an enormous archive of classic concerts, some dating back to the 1920s. But itâ€™s different from Relisten in that it wasnâ€™t designed for streaming, and the only way to discover content is by searching directly or scrolling through massive lists. Once you find a show you want to listen to, you have to download it, and often convert it from FLAC.

I wrote a few scripts to scrape SugarMegs, build the file URLs, extract and clean the metadata (as much as I could), and store everything in a MongoDB database. Then I recycled the last iteration of the music player Iâ€™d built and made [Sugarstream](https://sugarstream.live/).

But now I realize, for discoverability, I should just help upload SugarMegs to YouTube and Internet Archive some day ðŸ™ƒ.
