Tolli was designed to help artists connect and collaborate with each other. Sort of like a dating app, but for creative projects instead of for dating. I helped them build their web app with the React framework Next.js. While working on Tolli, I learned to build efficiently within the constraints of a startupâ€™s limited budget while prioritizing important security considerations like content moderation and user privacy.

Designed by my brother, [Gage](https://gagesalzano.com/).
