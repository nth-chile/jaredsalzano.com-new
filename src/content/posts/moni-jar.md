Moni Jar was a mobile app designed to let people collaboratively save money in a shared virtual savings jar for things like vacations, gifts, and events. I hired two developers to help me and led the development of the iOS pre-release build.

I gained hands-on project management experience, coordinating with the client, defining and delegating tasks, and keeping everything on track. I broke the work into flows like login, payments, and jar management, which helped us plan, budget, build, test, and deliver steady progress to the client.

I helped the client make smart tradeoffs: explaining when a feature was expensive, suggesting simpler MVP alternatives, or identifying when a spec adjustment could let us use a third-party solution instead of building custom.
