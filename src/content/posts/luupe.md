As [The Luupe](https://theluupe.com/) grew their audience, they needed to launch a marketing blog to share stories and engage their creative community. Later, they expanded their vision into a full-fledged web platform to support a growing global marketplace of women and non-binary photographers.

First, I built and shipped several iterations of their marketing blog to help establish an early online presence. As their community grew, I built a custom React UI library to streamline product development, and contributed to the development of a full-featured app that showcased artist portfolios, enabled networking and discoverability, incorporated paid feature access, and provided project management tools.

This work helped The Luupe empower hundreds of women and non-binary photographers across 50 countries by providing them with significant economic opportunities. The company has raised $3 million in seed funding, led by Wave Ventures, and collaborates with brands like Sweetgreen, Peloton, and Facebook to deliver diverse, high-quality visual content. The Luupeâ€™s innovative approach to connecting underrepresented creators with global brands has been highlighted by investors and media outlets such as Forbes and Quartz.
