This [2016 annual report](https://826chi-2016.jaredsalzano.com/) for Chicago nonprofit [826CHI](https://www.826chi.org/) showcases the organizationâ€™s work supporting students in developing their writing skills and helping teachers inspire their students to write.

This was the first website I ever built for a client. My brother, [Gage](https://gagesalzano.com/), took it on as a pro-bono project and invited me to help by writing code to match his designs. It was a really tricky first project, with a lot of free-floating elements that needed to work across screen sizes, and I also learned to draw with the HTML `<canvas>` element.
