This [2017 annual report](https://826chi-2017.jaredsalzano.com/) for Chicago nonprofit [826CHI](https://www.826chi.org/) showcases the organization's work supporting students in developing their writing skills and helping teachers inspire their students to write.

My brother, [Gage](https://gagesalzano.com/), took this on as pro-bono project and invited me to help by writing code to match his designs. The main challenge was implementing a design that presented information in a variety of creative ways rather than using repeatable layouts, and ensuring that it was responsive without compromising the look & feel of the desktop layout.
